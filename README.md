# technical question
 solution for the technical interview question
Solution to the programming interview question. For the language I chosed Javascript. Json file was parsed as an array into the array.

To run the program:  
1.Please clone this repository on your local machine.

2.Access the cloned repository.

3.Execute `node main.js {{translationKey}}`, where `translationKey` = `['cym','deu','fra','hrv','ita','jpn','nld','por','rus','spa']`. 

NOTES:
`function removeDuplicates(keys)` was implemented to remove duplicates from original array of translation keys. Since few countries have some specific keys, usage of `[0]` to get keys from first country was not a good idea. 

The code was formatted using "eslint" standarts.
