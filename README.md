# technical question
 solution for the technical interview question
Solution to the programming interview question. For the language I chosed Javascript. Json file was parsed as an array into the array.

The solution was implemented using Javascript. 
Please download .json file before running code and change the direction to it in `require()` function, since I wrote it for my local machine. 
My idea was converting the data from .json into an array and use .map to return specific parameter/index.
